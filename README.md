# Sentiment Analysis Classifier with ML.NET
This repository contains a sentiment analysis classifier built using ML.NET's Model Builder. The application classifies Yelp reviews into positive and negative sentiments.

## About
The project uses a Yelp dataset which includes text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (1 for positive and 0 for negative). The model predicts whether a review is positive or negative based on the review's text. This type of problem is a typical binary classification task.

## Features

1. <h3>ML.NET Model Builder</h3> The project uses ML.NET's Model Builder, which provides an easy-to-understand visual interface for building, training, and deploying custom machine learning models.
2. <h3>Automated machine learning (AutoML)</h3> The model builder uses AutoML to select the best algorithm and hyperparameters by trying out multiple combinations and returning the model that provides the highest accuracy.
3. <h3>Binary Text Classification</h3> The project is an example of binary text classification, one of the most common applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## How to Run
You can clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio. Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed.
